Next.js is a popular React.js framework and currently recommended by the React team for scaffolding new apps. It has a myriad of features, such as static site generation and server-side rendering, as well as built-in routing.

Next.js routing system operates based on the file structure. The essence of the routing process is basically mapping the URL to a `page.js` file nested within the `app` folder at your project's root. To use the routing system correctly, you'll need to understand how the way you name your files and folders informs the url structure.

## Part 1: Overview of Next.js Routing

To create a route in Next.js, you'll create a new `page.js` file in the `app` folder. Next.js looks for `page.js` files within a folder to understand what view to show to a user at a certain route.

The `page.js` file at the root of your `app` folder is what a user will see when they visit the root of your site at `http://localhost:3000/`

```jsx
// app/page.js

function Home() {
	return <h2>Home</h2>;
}
export default Home;
```

To create another route at http://localhost:3000/about you would need to create an `about` folder with a `page.js` file. The folder name determines the url path:

```jsx
// app/about/page.js
function About() {
	return <h2>About</h2>;
}
export default About;
```

To link pages add the following use the `Link` component from `next/link` and update your `layout.js` file:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
	return (
		<html lang='en'>
			<body>
				<nav>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<Link href='/'>Home</Link>
						</li>
						<li>
							<Link href='/about'>About</Link>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</nav>
				{children}
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

The `layout.js` component is shared across page and is a good choice for navigation or footers to be placed.

## Part 2: Dynamic Routes

A dynamic route is a route that is determined at runtime or while the application is running. Instead of being hardcoded into the application, these routes are often based on user interaction or data from a database. In Next.js, dynamic routes are represented using square brackets `[id]` in the file or directory name.

For example, if you have a blog and want to create a unique route for each blog post, instead of creating a static route for each post, you could create a dynamic route like `app/posts/[id]/page.js`.

Here, [id] is a placeholder for the actual ID of each post. So when a user navigates to /posts/1, Next.js will render the page at app/posts/[id]/page.js and pass the value 1 as a parameter that can be accessed within the page. The specific ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) is determined dynamically based on the URL at runtime. This allows for a flexible and efficient routing mechanism.

## Part 3: Accessing Params from Dynamic Routes

Accessing route parameters is essential for many different use cases in web development. Here are a few reasons why you might want to do so:

1. **Dynamic content loading**: In most applications, you'll want to fetch and display data that corresponds to specific identifiers. For example, in a blog, you might want to display a specific post based on its unique ID, which is included in the URL as a route parameter. This dynamic data loading is essential for displaying user profiles, product details, individual posts, and much more.

2. **State restoration**: In some cases, you may want to restore the user's application state based on the URL. The URL can act as a kind of "save state" that includes all the necessary parameters to recreate a certain view. This can be helpful in scenarios like complex forms, filters in data visualization or search applications where the state of filters can be reflected in the URL.

3. **Analytics**: When the app navigation depends on route parameters, it gives you the ability to track user interactions more accurately. For instance, you can gather insights about user behavior, such as which product or blog post is most visited, by examining the route parameters.

4. **Sharing and Bookmarking**: When specific content (like a product page, an article, a specific view of data, etc.) has a unique URL (made possible by route parameters), users can easily share or bookmark that URL. When the URL is revisited, the route parameters can be used to regenerate that specific content.

Next.js provides a `useRouter` hook that allows you to access the route parameters.

The name you give to your dynamic route file or directory in the app folder corresponds to the key you'll use to access the route parameter from router.query object.

For example, let's say you have a file named app/posts/[id]/page.js. The [id] part of the filename is a placeholder for the route parameter, and you can access its actual value from within your component like so:

```jsx
// app/posts/[id]/page.js
'use client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Post() {
	const router = useRouter();
	const { id } = router.query;

	return <h2>Post Id: {id}</h2>;
}

export default Post;
```

The `[id]/page.js` file corresponds to any route in the `/posts/<something>` format, granting access to `<something>` as `router.query.id` within your component.

## Part 4: Navigation

You can also use the `useRouter` hook for programmatically navigating your application.

Sometimes you will want to navigate a user to another page without using a `<Link>`. For example, perhaps after they sign in you want to route them to your main page.

There are several reasons why you might want to implement this:

1. **Form Submission**: After a user submits a form, it's common to redirect them to another page. For example, upon successful submission of a contact form, you might want to navigate the user to a "Thank You" page.

2. **User Workflows**: In multi-step processes (like a multi-page form, a quiz, or a checkout process), you might want to guide the user through specific steps in a sequence. Programmatic navigation lets you control this flow.

3. **Interactions Resulting in Navigation**: Certain user interactions might require navigation to a new page. For example, clicking on a notification in a list might navigate to the related item or activity.

4. **Error Handling**: In case of an error or an exception, you might want to programmatically navigate the user to a dedicated error page or a recovery flow.

In all these cases, having control over your navigation programmatically can help you build a more robust and user-friendly application.

Here's an example of using `useRouter` within Next.js

```jsx
// app/page.js
'use client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Home() {
	const router = useRouter();

	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Home</h2>
			<button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>Go to About</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Part 5: Accessing the URL in an App

You've no doubt seen query parameters in urls you've visited but perhaps you didn't know what they were used for.

They are appended to the end of a URL after a '?' character and are separated by '&' characters.

For example, in the URL `https://example.com/search?q=query&sort=desc`, `q` and `sort` are the query parameters.

Here are some common reasons to use query parameters in your application:

1. **Filtering and Sorting**: Query parameters are often used in APIs and web applications to filter and sort data. For example, an e-commerce website might use query parameters to filter products by category, sort them by price, and paginate the results.

2. **Tracking**: Query parameters can be used to track where traffic comes from. For example, if you're running an ad campaign, you might add a query parameter to the URL to identify which ads are effective.

3. **Stateful Links**: You might use query parameters to store a small amount of state in the URL. For example, a map application might store the current zoom level and map center in the URL so that when the user shares the URL, the recipient sees the same view.

4. **Conditional Rendering**: Query parameters can control what to display on a page. For instance, you can show different content based on a query parameter's value, making a page's content dynamic without needing to create multiple separate pages.

While query parameters are very useful, it's important to remember that they're visible to everyone who can see the URL. This means they're not suitable for sensitive data like passwords or other private information. Additionally, because users can easily modify query parameters, your application should handle unexpected values gracefully.

Within Next.js, you can also access query parameters and the current path via the `useRouter` hook.

```jsx
// app/posts/page.js
'use client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Posts() {
    const router = useRouter();
    const { sort } = router.query;

    // Fetching data based on sort
    useEffect(() => {
        fetch(`/api/posts?sort=${sort}`)
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => /* do something with the data */);
    }, [sort]);

    // ...
}

export default Posts;
```

In this scenario, we access the query string and fetch data based on these values. This approach allows us to display content specific to each user's navigation, thereby creating a more dynamic and personalized user experience.

As with React Router, bear in mind that query strings are part of the URL and are visible to users. Consequently, ensure not to include sensitive information in them. Furthermore, users can manually alter these values, so make sure your application can gracefully handle unexpected values.
